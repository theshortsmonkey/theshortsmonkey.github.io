        <h3>Indy's best bits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>She is a cutie</li>
            <li>She loves going on walks</li>
            <li>She loves to sleep, particularly snoring (because of her short little nose)</li>            
        </ol>
        <h3>Can you guess what breed she is?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>She has black and white fur</li>
            <li>She is a small-medium sized dog</li>
            <li>She loves to retrieve, particularly balls but her ancestors retrieved birds on the moors</li>
            <li>She loves her family</li>
            <li>She is very gentle</li>
            <li>She might have a big brother who is much 'springier' than her</li>
            <li>She has black pads to her paws (that is critical for those in the know ;-)</li>
        </ul>
